GitHub Scraper Tool that automatically goes through every subfolder, checks for file extensions, and can search for specific terms. Fully customizable.


If you would like to try this tool, you can test it on my Github profile. The repository named "TestRepo" has various different files and subfolders with fake passwords and user information.
